This mod simply adds "Death" from the "Puss in boots: the last wish" movie with a few complicated features such as spawning randomly and attacking a specific player, spawning near players one at a time, and playing sounds based on specific conditions.
Requires Geckolib Version: 4.x.x and Forge Version: 1.20.1, it is recommended to use with shaders.
It may take a long time for "Death" to spawn (1-3 Minecraft days)
